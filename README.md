# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves the classification of Iris flowers into three different species using the Logistic Regression model. The three species are:

1) Setosa
2) Versicolor
3) Virginica

## Dataset
We have used the Iris flower dataset containing the following columns:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species

## Data Preprocessing
### Step 1: Check Columns
Checked the columns of the dataset.

### Step 2: Check Metadata
Reviewed the metadata of the dataset.

### Step 3: Check Central Tendencies
Analyzed central tendencies of the data including count, mean, standard deviation, min, and max values.

### Step 4: Check for Duplicates
Identified and removed duplicate rows from the dataset.

### Step 5: Check for Null Values
Checked for null or NA values in the dataset.

## Visualization
Visualized the dataset using seaborn pairplot to understand the relationships between variables.

## Data Preparation
Separated the variables and output, where all four properties (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) are considered as variables, and species as the output.

## Splitting Training and Testing Data
Split the data into training and testing sets using a test size of 20%.

## Logistic Regression Model
Trained a Logistic Regression model using the training data.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model's accuracy on the testing data, achieving an accuracy score of 100%.
